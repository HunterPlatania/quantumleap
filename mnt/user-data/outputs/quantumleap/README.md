## 🚀 Quick Start (30 minutes setup)

### Prerequisites
You need these installed first:
- **Python 3.10+** - Download from https://python.org
- **Node.js 18+** - Download from https://nodejs.org

### Step 1: Install Backend (Quantum Engine)

Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and run:

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows users: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

You should see:
```
🚀 QuantumLeap Backend Starting...
✅ Server running on http://localhost:5000
```

**LEAVE THIS TERMINAL OPEN!**

### Step 2: Install Frontend (User Interface)

Open a **NEW** terminal and run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Browser will auto-open to: **http://localhost:3000**

## ✅ Test It Works

1. Click the **H** button (Hadamard gate)
2. Click **"Run Circuit"**
3. You should see:
   - Bar chart showing ~50% |0⟩ and ~50% |1⟩
   - Bloch sphere with vector on equator
   - Execution time displayed

**If this works → SUCCESS! Your quantum simulator is running! 🎉**
